# import and transform the data
# probably using pandas

# structure
# input is 28*28 grayscale pixels(0-255?), thus 784 input neurons
# 2 hidden layers of 16
# 10 output neurons
# starting to set in that this may be a more laborious task than anticipated, but I guess that gives me motivation to learn how to code it efficiently
# maybe not, numpy has good functions

# structure - random
# way to randomly assign initial weights for each layer
# '''
# 
# '''
# create
# a matrix with size ? and populate it with random numbers between ? and ?
# initial_weights = np.random.rand(raw_training_data.shape()) # need to add additional params to define the random numbers, and consult style guide for variables

# np.multiply(mmatrix1,mmatrix2)
