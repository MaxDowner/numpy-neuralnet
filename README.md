This project is an attempt to recreate the Neural Net shown in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi using numpy. It's intended as a learning excercise to ensure I'm fully comfortable with not just the implementation of Neural Nets but the underlying reasoning and structure.

(Summarised it's a Neural Net acting on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9)

Step 1
My first step is going to be to try and recall everything I need for a NN from what I've learnt and outline as much as I can before referring back to the video series in question (as well as other outside resources).
